Arrays: Use what you have learned about arrays to complete the problem below.

Implement a solution so that all test specs pass when you run the following
command in your terminal:
npm test test/02-exclusive-range-spec.js
*/

// Define a function called exclusiveRange that takes in a minimum number and a
// maximum number as two parameters. Return an array containing all the numbers
// between the minimum and maximum numbers, not including the minimum and
// maximum numbers.
// Eg: If the minimum number is 2 and the maximum number is 5, then the function
// should return an array of [3, 4].

// Your code here
